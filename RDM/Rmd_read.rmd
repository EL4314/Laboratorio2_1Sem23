## Introduction

This is an example R Markdown document to plot data from a text file.

### Data

Here's how we can read in the data from the file:

```{r}
data <- read.table("data.txt")
```

### Plot

Here's a scatter plot of the data:

```{r}
plot(data$X, data$Y, main = "Scatter Plot of X vs Y")
```
